# Build System Consolidation â€“ Part 1 Status

## Completed
- Step 1: Defined the driver interface and shared flag bundles (`codetracer_flags.env`) for debug/release profiles and Nim target classes.
- Step 2: Implemented `tools/build/build_codetracer.sh` with target metadata, dry-run support, and extensibility hooks for extra defines/flags.
- Step 3: Added dry-run smoke tests (`tools/build/tests/dry_run_test.sh`) and documentation (`tools/build/README.md`) describing usage.
- Part 2 Step 1: Tup rules (`src/ct/Tupfile`, `src/Tupfile`) now invoke `tools/build/build_codetracer.sh` for all Nim/JS artefacts, eliminating direct `nim` command lines.
- Part 2 Step 2: Developer helpers (e.g., `just build-ui-js`, `build_for_extension.sh`) now delegate to the shared driver with `--extra-define` hooks instead of embedding Nim invocations.
- Part 2 Step 3: Packaging flows (non-Nix `build_with_nim.sh`, AppImage scripts, and `nix/packages/default.nix`) call the shared driver with environment-specific overrides, removing duplicated Nim flag sets from release tooling.

## Next
- Validate end-to-end packaging outputs (macOS app, AppImage, Nix build) and update contributor docs once CI passes with the centralized driver.
