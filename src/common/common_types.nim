# this module is used in codetracer and core and in the nim plugin so
# it needs to support both C and JavaScript
# try to use langstring when something is
#  string in c backend and cstring in javascript backend
# TODO unify most type definitions for the backends
# currently a lot of app data is saved in data: Data and it's accessed as a global object in renderer.nim and ui_js.nim
