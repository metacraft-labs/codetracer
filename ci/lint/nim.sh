# Every check here runs through ci/lib/lint-steps.sh, which reports all of them
# from one run and decides the exit status at the end. The reason is written up
# in that file: this script used to be a flat `set -e` list whose FIRST command
# was `just test-nimsuggest`, and that command had been crashing, so the
# test-lane coverage guard below it had never executed in CI. A guard that
# cannot run is not a guard.
#
# Order is now cheapest-and-most-portable first. The lane-coverage checks are
# pure bash and git — no Nim toolchain, about a second — so their answer
# ("you added a test file and no lane will ever run it") reaches the log before
# anything that needs a compiler.

# words that "enforcement is an import lint, not discipline", and
# BlockTracer/Client-SDK.md §1.1 asks for the mirror of the same rule.

# Same order as above and for the same reason: the contract suite runs before
# the guard it covers, because a guard nobody has watched fail is not evidence.
