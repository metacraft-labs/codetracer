there is an issue on line 88 in Playwright Launcher.cs:

'IPlaywright' does not contain a definition for 'DisposeAsync' and no accessible extension method 'DisposeAsync' accepting a first argument of type 'IPlaywright' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)CS1061

in the LaunchAsync function in:
            if (playwright is not null)
            {
                try
                {
                    await playwright.DisposeAsync();
                }
                catch
                {
                    // Swallow cleanup errors during launch failure.
                }
            }
