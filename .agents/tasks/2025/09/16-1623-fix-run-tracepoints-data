I got a runtime error on line 265 in RunTracepointsJsAsync in EditorPane.cs:

The frontend function runTracepoints requires the global data object as an argument, but RunTracepointsJsAsync calls it without passing that parameter. As a result, runTracepoints receives undefined, and its attempt to access data.services throws the TypeError observed.

Update the RunTracepointsJsAsync function so that this problem does not occur again
