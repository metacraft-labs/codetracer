Create a page object for the layouts page editor panes
For this create a folder for the Edditor pane
Inside create page objects for the pane itself, the lines of code, the trace log panel and the omniscient loop controlls

Add locators for the following features:

Lines of code

#editorComponent-{id} .monaco-editor .view-lines > .view-line – each rendered source line.

Gutter and line numbers

.monaco-editor .margin-view-overlays > .gutter[data-line="{line}"] – wrapper for icons & line number.

Child elements inside each gutter:

.gutter-line – line number text.

.gutter-trace – enabled tracepoint icon.

.gutter-disabled-trace – disabled tracepoint icon.

.gutter-breakpoint-enabled, .gutter-breakpoint-disabled, .gutter-breakpoint-error – breakpoint states.

.gutter-no-breakpoint, .gutter-no-trace – empty placeholders.

.gutter-highlight-active – marker showing the current debugger location.

Currently selected line

.monaco-editor .view-overlays .current-line – overlay for active line background.

.monaco-editor .margin .line-numbers.active-line-number (or Monaco’s default active-line-number) – active line in the gutter.

Highlighted lines (executed or emphasized)

.line-flow-hit – bold/highlighted lines hit during execution.

.highlight – generic highlight decoration applied by editor code.

.gutter-highlight-active – gutter arrow pointing at highlighted line.

Grayed-out lines

.line-flow-skip – lines skipped during execution (opacity 0.5).

.line-flow-unknown – lines with unknown flow information (opacity 0.5).

Omniscient loop controls

.flow-loop-button.backward / .flow-loop-button.forward – step backward/forward within a loop.

.flow-loop-slider-container with child .flow-loop-slider – slide through loop iterations.

.flow-loop-step-container, .flow-loop-shrinked-iteration, .flow-loop-continuous-iteration – containers for loop iteration blocks.

Omniscience value displays next to code

.flow-loop-value / .flow-parallel-value – container for logged values.

.flow-loop-value-name / .flow-parallel-value-name – variable name labels.

.flow-loop-textarea – editable expression field (semi-transparent until focused).

.flow-multiline-value-box and .flow-multiline-value-pointer – value boxes with pointers for multi-line results.

In addition add functions that:
Returns if the current edditor has a currently selected line active
Returns the line number of the currently selected active line
Returns a list of the the currently highlited lines of code
Returns a list of the currenlty grayed out lines of code
Returns the line number of a line of code
Returns a list of flow parralel values from the omiscience that is attached to the line of code
Returns a list of active Omniscient loop controlls
Accepts a line of code and opens a trace point at that line of code
