Implement stdio transport for DAP. By default use the unix domain socket transport,
but if `--stdio` is passed with CLI use stdio transport. In it: receive
messages by stdin and send responses/events in stdout.

Add a simple test that runs db-backend in a separate process, but uses the stdio transport 
and initializes the interaction.
