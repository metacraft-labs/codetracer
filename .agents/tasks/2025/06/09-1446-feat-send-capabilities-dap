Make the initialized response well typed (add types for it and its fields)
using spec_dap.md

Send also capabilites in it, set explicitly those fields to true:

supportsLoadedSourcesRequest
supportsStepBack
supportsConfigurationDoneRequest
supportsDisassembleRequest
supportsLogPoints
supportsRestartRequest

add to the existing tests that the client receives capabilites
