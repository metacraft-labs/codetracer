# Codebase insights
- Ruby loops were originally detected only for 'while' and 'until'.
- 'each' loops can be recognized by handling 'call' nodes with a block whose method name is 'each'.
- Added a regression test ensuring `ExprLoader` detects Ruby `each` loops correctly.
- The `tui` crate contains a sample trace under `src/tui/trace/` used for basic testing.
- The Debug Adapter Protocol client communicates over a Unix domain socket using the same framing protocol, implemented in `src/tui/src/dap_client.rs`.
- Added initial SetBreakpoints handling in db-backend DAP server.
- When using the DAP stdio transport, all diagnostic output must go to stderr
  to avoid corrupting the message stream.


- The db-backend DAP server now responds to the `configurationDone` request.

- Build scripts across the project now rely on electron-builder to produce
  platform-specific Electron binaries. On macOS the builder consumes
  `resources/CodeTracer.icns` and `Info.plist` for proper branding.
- Electron builds run from the `node-packages` directory; `package.json`
  now lists `electron` as a dev dependency and defines a `postinstall` step to
  ensure native modules match the bundled Electron version.
- Updating Electron or other dependencies requires regenerating `yarn.lock` and updating `yarn-project.nix` with the new cache hash.
