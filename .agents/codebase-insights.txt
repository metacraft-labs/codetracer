# Codebase insights
- Ruby loops were originally detected only for 'while' and 'until'.
- 'each' loops can be recognized by handling 'call' nodes with a block whose method name is 'each'.
- Added a regression test ensuring `ExprLoader` detects Ruby `each` loops correctly.
- The `tui` crate contains a sample trace under `src/tui/trace/` used for basic testing.
- The Debug Adapter Protocol client communicates over stdio with messages framed by a `Content-Length` header, implemented in `src/tui/src/dap_client.rs`.
