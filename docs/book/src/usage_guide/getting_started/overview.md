# Overview

Welcome to the CodeTracer's getting started section. This guide will help you understand how to record and replay programs in each of the supported programming languages.

## Core Concept: Record and Replay

Unlike traditional debuggers that attach to a running process, CodeTracer works by first **recording** your application's execution into a trace file. This trace captures everything that happens during the run.

Once a recording is made, you can **replay** it as many times as you need in the CodeTracer GUI. This allows you to inspect the application's state at any point in time, move forwards and backwards through the execution, and use powerful features like tracepoints without having to run your application again.

Think of it like recording a video of your program's execution that you can then analyze in detail.
