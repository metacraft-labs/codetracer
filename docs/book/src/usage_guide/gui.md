### Startup screen

You can open the startup screen with `ct`.

There you can see a list of the recent traces, and open them directly, or to open them from the filesystem
using the `Open local trace` dialog. This is the graphical alternative to `ct replay`.

You can graphically record a new trace using the `Record new trace` dialog. 
This currently works only for noir projects: you should navigate to the root of the noir project folder, with the record dialog,
select and press `Run`.
If it is recorded correctly, it should open directly the replay interface.
