# UI Tests Documentation

This directory centralizes reference material for contributors working on the UiTests project.

- `coding-guidelines.md` captures expectations for test code quality, async patterns, and Playwright usage.
- `extending-the-suite.md` explains how the solution is structured and how to add new page objects or scenario tests.
- `debugging.md` lists practical steps for diagnosing flaky runs and local environment issues.

Whenever you add or refactor functionality, update the relevant document so future contributors—and automation agents—have reliable guidance.
