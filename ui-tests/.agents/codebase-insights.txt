- 2024-12-09: Added `docs/` directory with starter guides (`coding-guidelines.md`, `extending-the-suite.md`, `debugging.md`) to centralize project documentation for human and AI contributors.
- 2024-12-09: UI tests require entering `nix develop` inside `ui-tests` (or trusting direnv) before running `./dotnet_build.sh` and `dotnet run`; the env provides compatible Playwright tooling.
- 2024-12-09: Added `.envrc` with `use flake`; direnv will auto-load the Nix toolchain when entering `ui-tests` if trusted via `direnv allow`.
- 2024-12-09: Debug launcher now strips `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`/`ELECTRON_NO_ATTACH_CONSOLE` before starting `ct`; otherwise Electron treats requests as Node and rejects `--remote-debugging-port`.
- 2024-12-09: `PlaywrightLauncher.LaunchAsync` returns `CodeTracerSession`, ensuring the Playwright browser and `ct` process are disposed so VS Code debug runs shut down cleanly.
- 2024-12-09: Scaffolded `../ui-tests-v3/` with documentation (debugging, extending, coding guidelines, specifications, development plan, progress log) to guide the next-gen UI test rebuild using existing `ui-tests/` and `/home/franz/code/repos/Puppeteer` as references.
- 2025-11-07: The former `../ui-tests-playground/` and `../ui-tests-startup-example/` experiments were deleted after their guidance was folded into `ui-tests-v3/docs/launching-multi-instance.md`, `docs/debugging.md`, and related specs. No external folders are required now; rely on the docs under `ui-tests-v3/`.
- 2025-11-03: Monaco's DOM markup does not reliably expose the active line after call-trace jumps; read `data.services.editor.open[path].viewLine` (or the attached `monacoEditor` position) when asserting editor navigation.
- 2025-11-05: Chromium cascades new windows whenever `--window-size` matches monitor dimensions; rely on `--start-maximized` plus an evaluated `window.moveTo/resizeTo` call to pin each web session to the selected monitor.
- 2025-11-05: `NoirSpaceShip.JumpToAllEvents` currently times out manipulating event log rows in both Electron/Web; temporarily disabled in `TestRegistry` pending investigation (see `docs/test-debug-temp/TestStatusReport.md` for logs).
- 2025-11-05: `dotnet run -- --list-monitors` prints detected displays (with EDIDs). Web/Electron runs now respect `BrowserWindow.PreferredDisplayEdid`/`PreferredDisplayIndex` and `Electron.PreferredDisplayEdid`/`PreferredDisplayIndex` when positioning windows; fallback is primary monitor.
- 2025-11-06: The Noir Space Ship flow loop slider only renders after Codetracer navigates into `iterate_asteroids`; select that call-trace entry (or jump to `shield.nr:14`) before waiting on `.flow-loop-slider`.
- 2025-11-27: Electron UI sessions start `ct` without overriding the LSP bridge port, so every instance binds the default 3100. Parallel Electron runs (e.g., `--profile=parallel --mode=Electron`) will spawn multiple LSP bridges that collide on 3100 unless the port is randomized via env (e.g., `CODETRACER_LSP_PORT` per process) or LSP startup is serialized.
- 2025-11-27: Component waits now respect runner setting `Runner:ComponentLoad:EventLogGracePeriodMs` (default 10000ms) and explicitly wait for the event log to drop its `td.dt-empty` “Loading...” placeholder before proceeding; adjust this if event log loads slowly in new traces.
