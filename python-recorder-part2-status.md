# Python Recorder DB Backend Integration â€“ Part 2 Status

## Completed
- Step 1: Language detection and enums now expose `LangPythonDb` for `.py` files and mark it as db-backed across shared language metadata.
- Step 2: `ct record` resolves the active Python interpreter, and passes db-backend arguments for the Python recorder branch.

## Next
- Step 3: Implement the Python branch in `db-backend-record` to invoke the recorder and import generated traces.
