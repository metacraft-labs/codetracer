# Python Recorder DB Backend Integration â€“ Part 2 Status

## Completed
- Step 1: Language detection and enums now expose `LangPythonDb` for `.py` files and mark it as db-backed across shared language metadata.
- Step 2: `ct record` resolves the active Python interpreter, forwards activation/diff flags, and passes db-backend arguments for the Python recorder branch.
- Step 3: `db-backend-record` invokes the recorder via the resolved interpreter, forwards activation/diff flags, and imports the generated traces.
- Step 4: CI runs a Python recorder smoke test that records `examples/python_script.py` through the db backend.
- Step 5: CLI help text, README, and docs share the Python db-backend parity story, including interpreter resolution, the `codetracer_python_recorder` requirement, and a dedicated getting-started guide.

## Next
- Step 6: Add validation coverage (Python end-to-end trace plus failure-mode messaging) for the db-backend integration.
