# Python Recorder DB Backend Integration â€“ Part 2 Status

## Completed
- Step 1: Language detection and enums now expose `LangPythonDb` for `.py` files and mark it as db-backed across shared language metadata.
- Step 2: `ct record` resolves the active Python interpreter, forwards activation/diff flags, and passes db-backend arguments for the Python recorder branch.
- Step 3: `db-backend-record` invokes the recorder via the resolved interpreter, forwards activation/diff flags, and imports the generated traces.
- Step 4: `ct record` performs a preflight check that `codetracer_python_recorder` can be imported, surfaces actionable guidance when it is missing or broken, and the docs/CLI help now point users to install the wheel themselves.
- Step 5: CLI help text, README, and docs share the Python db-backend parity story, including interpreter resolution, the `codetracer_python_recorder` requirement, and a dedicated getting-started guide.
- Step 6: CI smoke test now records a Python trace inside a virtualenv, validates metadata fields, and exercises failure modes for missing recorder modules and missing interpreters.

## Next
- Milestone: remove the feature flag once cross-platform packaging and CI smoke tests are green.
