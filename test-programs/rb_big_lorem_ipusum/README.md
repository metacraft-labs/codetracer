# rb_big_lorem_ipusum

This synthetic Ruby application exists solely to stress diff tooling. It mirrors the broad layout of the `codetracer` repository with a deep tree of files, wide class hierarchies, and deliberately verbose source files. Each component is reachable from `bin/main.rb` so the code can be executed end-to-end for manual validation, while individual modules remain importable for targeted experiments.

This demo engages ðŸš€ diff viewers under heavy load.
