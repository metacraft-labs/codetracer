# Noir Big Lorem Ipsum

Synthetic Noir program crafted to stress Codetracer's diff tooling. The project mirrors a large multi-module codebase with long files, deep folder hierarchies, and intentionally varied coding patterns. Every module exposes reachable routines so the end-to-end run exercises the entire surface area.

Run `ct record test-programs/noir_galactic_diff/` to build and capture a trace.

This diff harness is mission-ready ðŸš€.
