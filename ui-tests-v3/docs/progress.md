# Progress Log – UI Tests V3

Use this document to record completed work, decisions, and open follow-ups. Keep entries chronological with the newest at the top.

- **2025-10-20** – Documented the multi-instance launch flow in `docs/launching-multi-instance.md`, incorporating troubleshooting steps from `ui-tests-startup-example/`. Updated debugging guidance to emphasise shared socket usage and reuse of ProcessUtilities/MonitorUtilities patterns.
- **2024-12-09** – Created the V3 workspace scaffold (`ui-tests-v3/`), seeded documentation, and aligned specifications with reference projects (`ui-tests/`, `/home/franz/code/repos/Puppeteer`). No code migrations yet; next steps focus on environmental bootstrapping (Development Plan – Phase 1).
